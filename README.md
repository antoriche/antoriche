# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Antonin Riche**, a **Fullstack Engineer** passionate about crafting web applications with modern technologies.  
The professional projects I develop are often **data visualization applications** and I enjoy building tools that drive insights and efficiency.  
I specialize in working with **Typescript** technologies and loves learning new tech-related stuff.

### 🔥 What I'm working on:

Most of my projects are private, but I have worked on impactful applications such as:

- A **data exploration tool** to monitor investments in the **energy transition** across Europe ⚡
- An **overcrowd prevention system** to predict queue times in **airports** ✈️
- A **military fleet management system** for **cybersecurity operations** 🛡️

I also enjoy coding my own projects for fun and experimentation:

- [Travle](https://antoriche.github.io/Travle) 🎮 – A small game where players must find the shortest path between two countries ([code](https://github.com/antoriche/Travle))
- [Brussels Running Challenge](https://d3ht7h1oliroyy.cloudfront.net) 🏃 – A challenge tracker using Strava activities to show the percentage of Brussels covered ([code](https://github.com/antoriche/brussels-running-challenge))
- Alarm ⏰ – A small alarm management app ([code](https://github.com/antoriche/alarm) - not deployed)
